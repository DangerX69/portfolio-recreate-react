# Personal Portfolio Project

This project is to mainly learn and implement the basics of html, css and javascript. I will be doing other tutorial based projects side by side to this while trying to complete it.

I have decided to use React for the ease of development as well as TailwindCSS for an easier time designing it. I will try to update this readme file with completion of each major components, or maybe just update it once the project is complete. :)
